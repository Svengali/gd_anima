# Dynamic "Initial" and/or "Final" value

Dynamic values let us provide a formula as initial and/or final value that depends by a node property or its surrounding.

:::tip

Dynamic value is the key to create truly reusable animations with Anima.

:::

## Arbitrary value

Before looking at dynamic values, let's have a look at following example:

```gdscript
Anima.begin_single_shot(self).then(
  Anima.Group($Grid)
    .anima_property("x")
    .anima_from(-100)
).play()
```

The animation translates in the group childs to their current position, as [we haven't defined any final value](/docs/docs/tutorial-basics/fundamentals) for `x`, from an initial position.

In the example the initial position is `[current_value] - 100`, supposing that **100** is the width of the node(s).

### Limitations of Arbitrary value

We assumed that **100** is the node's width, but:

1. there is no real correlation between the number and real width
2. inside the grid we might have node with different widths

Also, if we change any size of the nodes, we would then adjust the animation with the new value.

#### Let's calculate it

Sure, we could calculate the value manually, for example:

```gdscript
Anima.begin_single_shot(self).then(
  Anima.Group($Grid)
    .anima_property("x")
    .anima_from($Grid.get_child(0).rect_size.x)
).play()
```

We fix the issue number **1**, but the 2nd still stands. Also, we made the code a bit less reusable, as we tighten our "from" value to a specific node.

## Dynamic value

Anima solves all the limitations of the **arbitrary values** by letting you specify a **dynamic formula** that is computed when the animation is initialised.


### Syntax

The syntax of a single dynamic value is:

```gdscript
[relative node]:[property]:[sub key]
```

| param | type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| relative node | Node | no | The node from whom retrieve the `property` and `sub key`. An empty value or `.` indicates the node animated itself |
| property | Variant | *yes* | The property value to compute |
| sub key | Variant | no | The property subkey |

### Example

```gdscript
Anima.begin_single_shot(self).then(
  Anima.Group($Grid)
    .anima_property("x")
    .anima_from("-:size:x")
).play()
```

Let's analyze the parts of the dynamic value, we have `:size:x`

| parameter | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| relative node |  | The value is empty, meaning that we're going to read the property and sub key from the node we're animating |
| property | size | The node size (or rect_size) |
| sub key | x | The size.x value |

**NOTE**: One thing we must keep in mind is that in Group and Grid animations, Anima creates an animation for each single node, so using `.` or `` for the **relative node** means get the property from the current child Anima is going to animate.

Let's be more specific and consider a Grid node with the following children:

| Node | size |
|---|---|
| Button | `Vector2(100, 100)` |
| Label | `Vector2(50, 30)` |
| Sprite | `Vector2(150, 80)` |

When anima generates the animation will compute `-:size:x` with:

| Node | from |
|---|---|
| Button | `-100` |
| Label | `-50` |
| Sprite | `-150` |

As we can see the initial value is replace with the animated Node width.

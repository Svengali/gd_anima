# Popup animation

Let's implement the following animation:

<ReactPlayer controls url="/docs/videos/popup.webm" />

As we can see the animation is made of 3 components:

1. Popup panel
2. Text
3. Button

To create the animation in Godot let's consider this basic Hierarchy:

![Popup example hierarchy](/img/tutorial/nodes/popup.png)

Before writing any code let's see how the animation is made:

- The panel opens
  - → **then** the text is animated
    - → **then** the button is animated but its starting time is anticipated of about 0.2 seconds

In this example the _Panel_ opening is realized animating the `scale:y` property from **0** → **1**. The _Label_ uses the [built-in](/ciao) **typewrite** animation; while the _Button_ uses the **tada** one.

We want to animate the popup as soon as the scene is open, so let's add our code inside the `_ready` function:

## The animation

```gdscript
func _ready():
  Anima.begin_single_shot(self)
```

In this case I'm adding an AnimaNode by code, but you could manually add one to the scene; there is no difference and is completely up to you.
Also, we can use either [begin](/docs/docs/anima/#begin) or [begin_single_shot](/docs/docs/anima/#begin_single_shot) without difference in how the animation is created/played. Is completely up to you to decide [which one suits your need](/docs/tutorials/basics/begin-vs-begin_single_shot).

### The Panel

Because we're animating a single node we're going to use the [Anima.Node](/docs/docs/anima/anima-node) utility class and its [anima_scale_y](/docs/docs/anima-declaration/#anima_scale_y) method:

```gdscript
.then( Anima.Node(self).anima_scale_y(1.0, 0.3).anima_from(0) )
```

The second parameter of `anima_scale_y` indicates the duration in seconds, and in this case is **0.3 seconds**.

:::note
We have manually specified the **from** value because, if omitted, Anima would use the `scale:y` value we have [when the animation is created](/docs/tutorials/basics/fundamentals).

### The Text

As we said before the text is animated by using the built-in **typewrite** animation:

```gdscript
.then( Anima.Node($VBoxContainer/Label).anima_animation("typewrite", 0.01) )
```

Once again we used the [Anima.Node](/docs/docs/anima/anima-node) utility class because we're animating a single node. While the [anima_animation](/docs/docs/anima-declaration/#anima_animation) let us specify the name of the animation to use and its duration.

:::note
**Typewrite** is a "special" animation where we specify the duration of animating the single character, instead of the entire animation.
:::

### The Button

The button animation starts slightly before the text one completes. So, before writing any code let's see how to achieve that:

We could define the animation as parallel, using the [with](/docs/docs/anima-node/#with-parallel-animations) syntax, but because the text animation depends by its length we would need to manually calculate the delay to apply.

So, how can we solve this? By using a negative delay :)

```gdscript
.then( Anima.Node($VBoxContainer/Button).anima_animation('tada', 0.5 ).anima_delay(-0.1) )
```

Now we don't need to worry about the length of the text as the button is always animated 0.1 second before the previous animation completes!

:::note
If we have a look at the [anima_delay](/docs/docs/anima-declaration/#anima_delay) documentation, we can see that we can also pass a negative number to anticipate the start of a sequential or parallel animation.
